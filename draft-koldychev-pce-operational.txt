1.  Introduction

   The PCEP protocol started off being purely stateless with PCReq and
   PCReply messages, see Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].  Stateless PCEP operates in a "pull"
   model, i.e., PCC has to periodically ask the PCE for updates to the
   path, even if the path has not changed.

   Stateful PCEP was later introduced in PCEP Extensions for the
   Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231].  Stateful PCEP operates in a "push"

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION                  July 2022


   model, where the PCC can register with PCE to receive future updates
   about the path, and there is no need to ask the PCE periodically.
   The current document serves to optimize the original procedure in
   [RFC8231] to optionally drop the PCReq and PCReply exchange, which
   greatly simplifies implementation and optimizes the protocol.

   Due to different interpretations of PCEP standards, it was found that
   implementations often had to adjust their behavior in order to
   interoperate.  The current document serves to clarify certain aspects
   of PCEP to make it easier to produce interoperable implementations of
   PCEP.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   MBB:  Make-Before-Break.  A procedure during which the head-end of a
      traffic-engineered path wishes to move traffic to a new path
      without losing any traffic, by first "making" a new path and then
      "breaking" the old path.

   Association parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], the combination
      of the mandatory fields Association type, Association ID and
      Association Source in the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the
      association group.  If the optional TLVs - Global Association
      Source or Extended Association ID are included, then they MUST be
      included in combination with mandatory fields to uniquely identify
      the association group.

   Association information:  As described in [RFC8697], the ASSOCIATION
      object could also include other optional TLVs based on the
      association types, that provides 'information' related to the
      association type.

   ERO:  Explicit Route Object is the path of the LSP encoded into a
      PCEP object.  To represent an empty ERO object, i.e., without any
      subobjects, we use the notation "ERO={}".  To represent an ERO

      object containing some given sequence of subobjects, we use the
      notation "ERO={A}".

3.  PCEP LSP Database

   We use the concept of the LSP-DB, as a database of actual LSP state
   in the network, to illustrate the internal state of PCEP speakers in
   response to various PCEP messages.

   Note that the term "LSP", which stands for "Label Switched Path", if
   taken too literally would restrict our discussion to MPLS dataplane
   only.  We take the term "LSP" to apply to non-MPLS paths as well, to
   avoid changing the name.  Alternatively, we could rename LSP to
   "Instance".

3.1.  Structure

   LSP-DB contains two types of objects: LSPs and Tunnels.  An LSP is
   identified by the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV.  A Tunnel is identified by the
   PLSP-ID in the LSP object and/or the SYMBOLIC-NAME.  See [RFC8231].

   A Tunnel may or may not be an actual tunnel on the router.  For
   example, working and protect paths can be implemented as a single
   tunnel interface, but in PCEP we would refer to them as two different
   Tunnels, because they would have different PLSP-IDs.

   An LSP can be thought of as a instance of a Tunnel.  In steady-state,
   a Tunnel has only one LSP, but during make-before-break (see
   [RFC3209]) it can have multiple LSPs, to represent both new and old
   instances that exist simultaneously for a time.

3.2.  Synchronization

   Both PCE and PCC maintain their separate copies of the LSP-DB.  The
   PCE LSP-DB is only modified by PCRpt messages, no other PCEP message
   may modify the PCE LSP-DB.  The PCC LSP-DB is built from actual
   forwarding state that PCC has installed.  PCC uses PCRpt messages to
   synchronize its local LSP-DB to the PCE.

   The PCE MUST always act on the latest state of the PCE LSP DB.  Note
   that this does not mean that the PCE cannot use information from
   outside of LSP-DB.  For example, the PCE can use other mechanisms to
   collect traffic statistics and use them in the computation.  However,
   these traffic statistics are not part of the LSP-DB, but only
   reference it.

   The LSP-DB on both the PCC and the PCE only stores the actual state
   in the network, it does not store the desired state.  For example,



Koldychev, et al.        Expires January 5, 2023                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION                  July 2022


   consider the case of PCE Initiated LSP, configured on the PCE.  When
   the operator modifies the configuration of this LSP, that is a change
   in desired state.  The actual state has not yet changed, so LSP-DB is
   not modified yet.  The LSP-DB is only modified after the PCE sends
   PCInit/PCUpd message to the PCC and the PCC decides to act on that
   message.  When the PCC acts on a message from a PCE, it would update
   its own PCC LSP DB and send a PCRpt to the PCE(s) to synchronize the
   change.  When the PCE receives the PCRpt msg, it updates its own PCE
   LSP DB.  After this, the PCC LSP-DB and PCE LSP-DB are in sync.

3.3.  Stateful Bringup

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in operationally
   down state, but at the same time mandates the use of PCReq, before
   sending PCRpt.  In this document, we would like to make it clear that
   sending PCReq is optional.

   We shall refer to the process of sending PCReq before PCRpt as
   "stateless bringup".  In reality, stateless bringup introduces
   overhead and is not possible to enforce from the PCE, because the
   stateless PCE is not required to keep any per-LSP state about
   previous PCReq messages.  It was found that many vendors choose to
   ignore this requirement and send the PCRpt directly, without going
   through PCReq.  Even though this behavior is against [RFC8231], it
   offers some advantages and simplifications, as will be explained in
   this section.  This document therefore updates [RFC8231].

   Even though all the major vendors today are moving to the stateful
   PCE model, it does not deprecate the need for stateless PCEP.  The
   key property of stateless PCEP is that PCReq messages do not modify
   the state of the PCE LSP-DB.  Therefore, PCReq messages are useful
   for many OAM ping/traceroute applications where the PCC wishes to
   probe the network topology without having any effect on the existing
   LSPs.

3.3.1.  Updates to RFC 8231

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, says "The only explicit way for a PCC to
   request a path from the PCE is to send a PCReq message.  The PCRpt
   message MUST NOT be used by the PCC to attempt to request a path from
   the PCE."  In this document we update [RFC8231] to remove the quoted
   text.

   As part of the new bringup procedure, the PCC MAY delegate an empty
   LSP (no ERO or empty ERO) to the PCE and then wait for the PCE to
   send PCUpd, without sending PCReq.  We shall refer to this process as
   "stateful bringup".  The PCE MUST support the original stateless
   bringup, for backward compatibility purposes.  Supporting stateful

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION                  July 2022


   bringup should not require introducing any new behavior on the PCE,
   because as mentioned earlier, the PCE does not modify LSP-DB state
   based on PCReq messages.  So whether the PCE has received a PCReq or
   not, it would process the PCRpt all the same.

   An example of stateful bringup follows.  In our example the PCC
   starts off by using LSP-ID of 0.  The value 0 does not hold any
   special meaning, any other 16-bit value could have been used.

   PCC has no LSP yet, but wants to establish a path.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0,
   ERO={}).

   PCC received a PCUpd from the PCE and has decided to install the
   ERO={A} from that PCUpd.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-
   FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0, ERO={A}).

3.4.  Successful MBB

   Below we give an example of doing MBB to switch the Tunnel from one
   path to another.  We represent the path encoded into the ERO object
   as ERO={A} and ERO={B}.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER-FLAG=UP).

                        Figure 3: Content of LSP DB

   PCC initiates the MBB procedure by creating a new LSP with LSP-ID=3.
   It does not matter what triggered the creation of the new LSP, it
   could have been due to a new path received via PCUpd (if the given
   Tunnel is delegated), or it could have been local computation on the
   PCC (if the Tunnel is locally computed on the PCC), or it could have
   been a change in configuration on the PCC (if the Tunnel's path is
   explicitly configured on the PCC).  It is important to emphasize that
   the procedure for updating the LSP-DB is common, regardless of the
   trigger that caused the change.

   PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER-
   FLAG=UP).

   After traffic has successfully switched to the new LSP, the PCC
   cleans up the old LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=1, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-
   ID=2).

3.5.  Aborted MBB

   The MBB process can abort when the newly created LSP is destroyed
   before it is installed as traffic carrying.  This scenario is
   described below.

4.  PCEP Association Database

   PCEP Association is a group of zero or more LSPs.

   The PCE ASSO DB is populated by PCRpt messages and/or via
   configuration on the PCE itself.  An Association is identified by the
   Association Parameters.  The Association parameters contain many
   fields, so for convenience we will group all the fields into a single
   value.  We will use ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_PARAM=B, to refer to different
   PCEP Associations: A and B, respectively.

   Association.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1).  The

   ASSOCIATION OBJECT in the first PCRpt during SYNC state, even if it
   has already issued a PCRpt with the association object sometime in
   the past with this PCE.  The synchronization steps outlined in

4.2.  Switch Association during MBB

   Below, we give an example to illustrate how a Tunnel goes through MBB
   and switches from Association A to Association B.

   Each new LSP (identified by the LSP-ID) does not inherit the
   Association membership of any previous LSPs within the same Tunnel.
   This is so that a Tunnel can have two LSPs that are in different
   Associations, this may be done when switching from one Association to
   another.

   PCC creates the first LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100,
   LSP-ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

5.  Computation Constraints

   For any PCEP object that does not have an explicit removal flag, the
   absence of that object indicates removal of the constraint specified
   by that object.  For example, suppose the first state-report contains
   an LSPA object with some affinity constraints.  Then if a subsequent
   state-report does not contain an LSPA object, then this means that
   the previously specified affinity constraints do not apply anymore.
   Same applies to all PCEP objects, like METRIC, BANDWIDTH, etc., which
   do not have an explicit flag for removal.  This simply ensures that
   it is possible to remove a constraint without using an explicit
   removal flag.

6.  Use of SR-RRO and SRv6-RRO objects

   [RFC8231] defines a PCRpt message which contains <intended-path>
   known as the ERO object and <actual-path> known as the RRO object.
   [RFC8664] defines SR-ERO and SR-RRO sub-objects for SR-TE LSPs.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] further defines SRv6-ERO and
   SRv6-RRO sub-objects for SRv6-TE paths.

   In practice RRO data is the result of signalling via a protocol such
   as RSVP-TE, which allows collection of per-hop information along the
   path.  The ERO and RRO values may be different as the path encoded in
   the ERO may differ than the RRO such as during protection conditions
   or if the ERO contains loose hops which are expanded upon.  As
   Segment Routing LSP does not perform any signalling, the values of an

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION                  July 2022


   SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO and SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO (respectively) are in practice
   the same, therefore some implementations have omitted the RRO when
   reporting a SR-TE LSP while others continue to send both ERO and RRO
   values.

   The following applies to SR-TE only.  If both ERO and RRO are present
   for the same LSP, it SHOULD be interpreted as the RRO being the
   actual path the LSP is taking but MAY interpret only the ERO as the
   actual path.  In the absence of RRO a PCE MUST interpret the ERO as
   the actual path for the LSP.  Until SR-TE introduces some form of
   signaling similar to RSVP-TE, the use of RRO is discouraged for SR-TE
   LSPs.
